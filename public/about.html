<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!
  <br />My name is Stefanie and I just started on my journey in the world of web development. It would mean a lot 
  to me if you check out my portfolio that documents the milestones on my adventure.</p>

<p>My actual occupation lies in the field of finance where I'm crunching numbers as a controller. I'm a huge Japan fan 
  and enjoy watching Japanese TV shows, movies, animes, youtube videos, you name it. I love crocheting cute amigurumis 
  and am also a horsegirl. For more than 20 years I was actively playing handball, which I recently quit. But I guess 
  that's ok once you cross the 30s-line.</p>

<p> So why did I pick up on programming now?
  <br />You could say Excel made me do it. It is one of my most important daily companions as a Controller. Over the years 
  I became quite experienced in combining and nesting formulas and operators to set up my calculations as needed. At 
  one point I felt that this is probably in some ways similar to programming, and also that this style of working has 
  its limitations. Maybe it would be good to learn Macro and VBA programming. However, my supervisor at that time 
  recommended me not to learn it and if I wanted to get some company-funded training I should pick something related to 
  Controlling techniques. That was quite disheartening to be honest and so the idea to dip my toe into the world of 
  programming fell into oblivion. But after some time it re-emerged from the depths of my subconsciousness and I started 
  looking for classes again on a private basis. I was quite overwhelmed by the many choices: Python, Data Science, Web Development, 
  AI, etc. ... they all sound interesting. But at the same time I could not find much courses that were flexible enough for someone 
  working fulltime and that were reasonably priced for someone not sure if programming is their cup of tea at all. Luckily there 
  was a Black Friday Sale on Udemy where I purchased two online bootcamp courses. Right now I am trying out web development 
  for a start. So far it is a lot of fun and I can follow along. I hope it stays that way on the still long journey to follow. 
  Once I finish that bootcamp, I will also try a bit of Python. And after that? That depends on whether I feel like having 
  a refill of that tea. üçµ</p>
